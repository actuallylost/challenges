/*

This challenge asks you to implement the GCD algorithm. This algorithm
returns the greatest common divisor of two numbers. That is, the largest
number that divides both numbers without a remainder.

For example:
 - gcd(15, 20) = 3
 - gcd(16, 8) = 8
 - gcd(3, 4) = 1

You do not need to consider negatives for this algorithm. You do, however, need
to make your algorithm efficient - this is tested for! If you get stuck, try
Googling for some results - you'll find there exists a rather fancy algorithm
that does this very efficiently...
